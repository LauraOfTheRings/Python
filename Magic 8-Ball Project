# Random number generator to be assigned to answer
random_number = random.randint(1,9)

# Assigning an answer:

if random_number ==1:
  answer = "Yes - definitely"
elif random_number == 2:
  answer = "It is decidedly so"
elif random_number == 3:
  answer = "Without a doubt"
elif random_number == 4:
  answer = "Reply hazy, try again"
elif random_number == 5:
  answer = "Ask again later"
elif random_number == 6:
  answer = "Better not tell you now"
elif random_number == 7:
  answer = "My sources say no"
elif random_number == 8:
  answer = "Outlook not so good"
elif random_number == 9:
  answer = "Very doubtful"
